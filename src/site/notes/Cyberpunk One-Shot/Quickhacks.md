## Quickhacks
Quickhacks can be installed inside a cyberdeck and can be utilized to take out or disorient enemies, or bypass defenses.

Each quickhack has a duration (the time the quickhack will be active), an upload time (the time it takes for the quickhack to take effect) and a RAM cost (the amount of cyberdeck ram is required to infect the target with a quickhack). Not all quickhacks have a cooldown (the time it takes before the quickhack can be used again). 

Once a quickhack is used most enemies will start to trace where is came from, the time it takes to trace a quickhack depends but after it has been traced enemies will know your position.

Each quickhack has a base RAM cost, but some enemies will have extra security and will add to the RAM cost of a quickhack, the RAM cost shown on the table is only the base RAM cost.

### Types
There are different types of quickhack, each with different uses

#### Combat
Combat quickhacks deal raw damage to enemies, often leaving a status effect on them. These quickhacks have a medium RAM cost. 

#### Control
Control quickhacks can apply various effects centered around distracting or disabling enemies, usually without directly nonfatally. These quickhacks have a low/medium RAM cost.

#### Covert
Covert quickhacks revolve around avoiding detection and allowing the user to strategically manipulate both enemies and the environment to this effect. These quickhacks typically do not start trace progress, which allows one to stay undetected in most situations. These quickhacks have the lowest RAM cost in most cases. 

#### Ultimate
Ultimate quickhacks produce some of the most powerful effects in the game, offset by having the largest RAM cost of all quickhacks. 

#### Device
These quickhacks come preinstalled on cyberdecks, determined by their manufacturer and tier. They are often used on objects and item during enemy encounters with the exception of Breach Protocol.
