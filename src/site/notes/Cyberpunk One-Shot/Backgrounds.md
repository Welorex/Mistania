## Nomad
>Roaming the Badlands, looting scrapyards, raiding fuel depots - life on the road wasn't easy. But growing up in a nomad clan has its perks. Honesty, integrity, and a love of freedom - qualities that few in Night City possess, and no amount of money can buy.

Your Character gets a +2 bonus to ability checks involving nomads and the wilderness
## Streetkid
>They say if you wanna understand the streets, you gotta live 'em. Gangs, fixers, dolls, small-time pushers - you were raised by them all. Down here the law of the jungle dictates the weak serve the strong - the only law in Night City you have yet to break.

Your Character gets a +2 bonus to ability checks involving Gangs and the city life

## Corpo
>Few leave the corporate world with their lives - fewer still with their souls intact. You've been there - you've bent the rules, exploited secrets and weaponized information. There's no such thing as a fair game, only winners and losers.

Your Character gets a +2 bonus to ability checks involving Corpos and Corporations
