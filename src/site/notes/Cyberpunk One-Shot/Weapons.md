### Weapon Ranges
Different weapons have different effective ranges, Add or Subtract from your attack roll based on the weapon your using and the distance of the attack. If a weapon range is N/A it means that it cannot fire that far.

## Autofire
When you use Autofire, it costs an Action and 15 bullets. If you don't have 15 bullets remaining in your clip, you can't use Autofire. Additionally, instead of the weapon's entry on the Range Table, you use its entry on the Autofire Range Table.

If you hit, roll 2d6 for damage, and multiply it by the amount you beat the enemy's AC by, up to a maximum denoted by the weapon's Autofire (3 for SMGS, 4 for Assault Rifles). This number is the amount of damage that Autofire dealt.
