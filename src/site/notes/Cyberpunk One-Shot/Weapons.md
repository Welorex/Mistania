If you don't have 15 bullets remaining in your clip, you can't use Autofire. Additionally, instead of the weapon's entry on the Range Table, you use its entry on the Autofire Range Table.

If you hit, roll 2d6 for damage, and multiply it by the amount you beat the enemy's AC by, up to a maximum denoted by the weapon's Autofire (3 for SMGS, 4 for Assault Rifles). This number is the amount of damage that Autofire dealt.
