## How does it work?
When you are targeted for an attack that would hit, you can chose to use your reaction to Dodge the attack or Block it. You cannot do both on the same attack, you must chose one.

### Dodging
When a player choses to Dodge an attack they must roll a Reflexes save, the DC being how much the enemy passed your AC by plus their reflex mod. For example if a players AC is 14 and the enemy hit for 16 and their reflex mod is +3 the DC would be 10 + 2 + 3 = 15. If you fail, you take the damage.

### Blocking
When a you chose to Block an attack you must roll a Body save, the DC being how much the enemy passed your AC by. For example if your AC is 14 and the enemy hit for 16 the DC would be 10 + 2 = 12. If you fail, you take the damage. On a success you take half damage When Blocking you use the weapon you are holding.
