## Quickhacks
Quickhacks can be installed inside a cyberdeck and can be utilized to take out or disorient enemies, or bypass defenses.

Each quickhack has a duration (the time the quickhack will be active), an upload time (the time it takes for the quickhack to take effect) and a RAM cost (the amount of cyberdeck ram is required to infect the target with a quickhack). Not all quickhacks have a cooldown (the time it takes before the quickhack can be used again). 

Once a quickhack is used most enemies will start to trace where is came from, the time it takes to trace a quickhack depends but after it has been traced enemies will know your position.

Each quickhack has a base RAM cost, but some enemies will have extra security and will add to the RAM cost of a quickhack, the RAM cost shown on the table is only the base RAM cost.

### Types
There are different types of quickhack, each with different uses

#### Combat
Combat quickhacks deal raw damage to enemies, often leaving a status effect on them. These quickhacks have a medium RAM cost. 

#### Control
Control quickhacks can apply various effects centered around distracting or disabling enemies, usually without directly nonfatally. These quickhacks have a low/medium RAM cost.

#### Ultimate
Ultimate quickhacks produce some of the most powerful effects in the game, offset by having the largest RAM cost of all quickhacks. 

#### Device
These quickhacks come preinstalled on cyberdecks, determined by their manufacturer and tier. They are often used on objects and item during enemy encounters with the exception of Breach Protocol.
