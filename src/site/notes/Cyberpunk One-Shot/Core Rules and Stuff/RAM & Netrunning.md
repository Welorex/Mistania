## RAM
RAM units is the amount of available RAM you have to execute quickhacks. Your max RAM is based on the base RAM from your cyberdeck and any additional RAM from perks.

You recover RAM at a rate of 1 RAM unit at the start of your turn, some perks increase the amount of RAM you recover per turn. 

### Quickhacking Guide
When using a quickhack you must be able to see the target for the quick hack (unless a perk says otherwise) then if you have enough RAM units available for the quickhack you send it into their system and after the upload is done the quickhack executes. You then remove the amount of RAM you used for the quickhack. Some enemies will have extra security increasing the amount of RAM needed to quickhack them.

## Netrunning
Netrunning refers to the act of plugging into an access point and getting past the systems defenses to gain access to a system. There are four main steps to netrunning, Plugging into an access point, getting past defenses, and controlling the system, then getting out.

### Plugging into an access point
A building will have multiple access point but each access point only controls certain parts of the building, in short one building will have multiple NET Architecture (see [fandom](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/NET_Architecture) for a better explanation). Usually each floor with have a NET Architecture to control everything on that floor so finding the right access point is crucial to hack the proper things. Once you found one you must be at least 5ft of it to plug in but once plugged in you can be 15ft away from it. 

#### NET Architecture
This is just to explain what is net architecture. A NET Architecture (net arc for short) is the system that controls certain devices. NET Arcs have multiple levels to them For example in a small store there would be a NET Arc for the cameras and security as well as any data, each on different levels of the net arch. You always start on the lowest level of a NET arc and work your way up. Once you leave the NET arc everything resets (except viruses).

### Fighting the defenses
This is where it gets complicated. To start there is a two types of actions, IRL action (things you can do IRL) and Net action (things you do in the net), On your turn in IRL Combat you can either choose to do an IRL Action (shooting, quickhacks) or your NET actions, either way you still get to use you movement.

You always start at the first level of the NET unless you put a virus on a later level, You have 3 NET actions you may perform per round your NET Action are shown in the table below. Moving between levels and Copying a file don't count as NET Actions.

There are many things in a NET arc some being, passwords (to block netrunners), demons (to operate control nodes), control nodes (to control cameras, etc), and Black ICE (to stop invaders)

Attacking in the NET is simple, roll 1d20 + INT mod vs the enemy's AC

| Jacking in/out              | Using a NET Action, you can Jack In to a NET<br>Architecture while within range (within 15ft,<br>blocked by walls) of one of its access points. Being<br>jacked in is a prerequisite for doing anything in an<br>Architecture. Moving out of the access point's range<br>while jacked in to the Architecture jacks you out of the<br>NET Architecture automatically, but leaves you vul-<br>nerable: You suffer the effect of all remaining<br>enemy Black ICE you've encountered, but not<br>disabled, in the NET Architecture before you<br>get "out." |
| Use Interface Ability       | All but one Interface Ability requires the use of at least<br>one NET Action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Control    | Lets you control devices connected to the NET Architecture through a Control Node. Each Node has a DC to take control as a NET Action.

You can't Slide preemptively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Virus      | Once you have reached the highest level of the NET Architecture you can leave your own Virus in the Architecture to perform up to 2 actions or changes, within reason. Using this ability is the only way a Netrunner can make a change to a NET Architecture that persists after they Jack Out. Describe to the GM what you want the virus to do, and they will assign a DC. A more powerful Virus will require a higher DC to leave in the Architecture, as determined by the GM. Depending what you want to do, this can require as many NET Actions<br>as the GM determines. |

#### Black ICE
Black ICE is a type of program when activated by encountering it will chase down the target until it is dead. Once you encounter Black ICE roll a reflexes save vs their Speed, on a fail suffer its effect immediately. It is then placed into the Initiative Queue at the top. On its turn it will attack the netrunner. Once a Black ICE has 0 hp it is disable not destroyed, and will enable again once the netrunner jacks out.

#### Demons
Demons are a type of Black ICE that have specific actions, they operate control nodes. Demons know everything about their NET which means that it is unimpeded by Passwords, is always aware of any Netrunner's presence, and automatically wins any Speed contest against a Program. So they have no speed and only use their remaining NET actions to attack.
