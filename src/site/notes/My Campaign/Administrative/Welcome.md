**FORWORD FROM PROFESER BEARBOR BOGUS V**

Salutations! And I [[Professor Bearbor Bogus V\|Professor Bearbor Bogus V]], bid you most welcome to my humble little library of scattered notes; the **Encyclopedia Mistania!**

I admit, my boundless ambition to one day publish this encyclopedia may have overshot the mark a bit, [[My Campaign/Geography & Politics/Other things/Mistania\|Mistania]], is a large place, far larger than I anticipated during my youth growing up in [[Zir\|Zir]].

Perhaps one day, my great grandson may collect this smattering of various notes, chapters and hastily written diary entries and publish the book as a series of volumes for 10 gold a piece; but for now this mess of a library is all that you're left with

I've been lucky: the [[College of Loravalur\|College of Loravalur]] has granted me a permanent study here and funded my exploits! They tell me I'm heading to the [[Astral Sea\|Astral Sea]] in a few days!

For the time being, may I direct you to one of our library sections;

- [[Species & Cultures\|Species & Cultures]], for the various intelligent peoples in our world!
- [[Religion & Deities\|Religion & Deities]], to understand gods, churches, and holidays!
- [[History & Myths\|History & Myths]], for an overview of all that's ever happened.
- [[My Campaign/Geography & Politics/Geography & Politics\|Geography & Politics]], to understand how best to navigate the world map 
- [[Adventures & Fiction\|Adventures & Fiction]], for an introduction for the countless stories told in [[My Campaign/Geography & Politics/Other things/Mistania\|Mistania]].

For information on a more meta level, and where to start and the adventure in Mistania; see [[My Campaign/Administrative/Introduction\|Introduction]].
