### The Great Divide

The Great Divide was a cataclysmic earthquake that reshaped the world and marked the beginning of the **Divided Era** 1395 years ago. Its impact was so profound that no records—or even memories—remain of the time before it.

Even the Dwarves, whose lifespans stretch back to before the Divide, have no recollection of how the world once was. Some scholars at the [[College of Loravalur\|College of Loravalur]] have dedicated their lives to uncovering remnants of the past, but so far, their efforts have yielded nothing. The truth of what came before remains a mystery, lost to time.
