> _The United Empires are one of the pillars that uphold our world. Without them, we would never have seen the next day. Empires supporting one another is the only path toward a brighter future._

## History

Following [[My Campaign/Geography & Politics/Other things/The Great Divide\|The Great Divide]] 1395 years ago, the separation of species led to growing tensions. In response, [[My Campaign/Geography & Politics/Alluvterre/The Solarian Empire/The Solarian Empire\|The Solarian Empire]] and [[The Eldran Empire\|The Eldran Empire]] collaborated to establish [[Mysterium\|Mysterium]]—a neutral ground where all empires could meet, discuss their affairs, and request aid. This marked the birth of the United Empires.

## Members

The United Empires consists of the five largest empires, along with representatives for key minority groups:

- **[[My Campaign/Geography & Politics/Alluvterre/The Solarian Empire/The Solarian Empire\|The Solarian Empire]]**
- **[[The Eldran Empire\|The Eldran Empire]]**
- **[[Loamnore Kingdom\|Loamnore Kingdom]]**
- **[[The Zephyr Isles\|The Zephyr Isles]]**
- **[[The Ravagog Dominion\|The Ravagog Dominion]]**
- **Lairnan** – Representative of the Aasimars
- **Damron** – Representative of the Tieflings
- **Neoman Swiftcarver** – Representative of the Goliaths

## How It Works

The United Empires convenes twice a year—once at the beginning of the year and again mid-year. During these meetings, representatives discuss the state of their empires, ongoing challenges, and progress on their **Special Projects**.

In addition to these regular meetings, each empire has the right to call one **emergency meeting** per year. These are typically requested in times of natural disasters, civil unrest, or—at worst—the potential collapse of an empire. In such cases, a vote determines whether immediate aid is granted or if assistance will be provided gradually over time. Once decisions are made, attendees may either return home or remain in [[Mysterium\|Mysterium]] for diplomatic work.

### Special Projects

Each new empire joining the United Empires is assigned a **Special Project**—a large-scale initiative meant to benefit all of Mistania.

So far, only one Special Project has been successfully completed: **[[The Warp Gate\|The Warp Gate]]**, which connects [[Khazdrun\|Khazdrun]] to [[Gildenspire\|Gildenspire]]. This extraordinary feat of engineering, accomplished by the [[Smallfolk\|Smallfolk]], remains one of Mistania’s greatest achievements. Other Special Projects are rumored to be nearing completion, and I eagerly await their unveiling.
