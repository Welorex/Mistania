> _"Fortune favors the bold, and justice follows the fearless."_

House Blackthorne is known for its relentless pursuit of adventure, exploration, and justice. While they still uphold the empire’s laws, they believe that true order comes not from strict governance but from providing opportunities for people to forge their own destinies. Blackthorne controls the **[[My Campaign/Adventures & Fiction/Adventurers’ Guild\|Adventurers’ Guild]]**, sponsoring explorers, treasure hunters, and mercenary companies who seek fortune and glory in the uncharted lands beyond the empire’s borders.

They oversee **Adventures, trade routes, and outposts**, ensuring law and order where civilization meets the unknown. Their Guardians, once feared as executioners, now act as enforcers of fair play—rooting out corruption, hunting down criminals, and ensuring that those who seek riches do so with honor. For House Blackthorne, justice is not just about punishment—it is about **giving people the chance to rise.**
