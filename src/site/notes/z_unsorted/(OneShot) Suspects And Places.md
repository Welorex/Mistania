---

###  **Master Rellin Trask**

- **Role:** The wine steward. Nervous, twitchy, and overly polite.
    
- **Motive:** Deep in **gambling debt**—rumor is he owed the Baron a favor he couldn’t repay.
    
- **Secret:** He **handled the wine bottle** before the toast, and his ledger shows a payment from an anonymous source.

- **Secret:** Carries a **vial of similar poison** (used for “stage effects”), but swears it wasn’t used.

## Places for Investigation
---

###  1. **The Wine Cellar – Poison Source**

>  Checks:

- **Investigation (DC 15):** Spot that _only one_ bottle is missing from a sealed vintage collection.
    
- **Arcana (DC 13):** Detect a faint magical glyph on the bottle shelf (a delayed necrotic sigil).
    
- **Insight (DC 15):** Notice the steward is _sweating more than he should be_, avoiding eye contact.
    

>  Clues:

- The poisoned bottle was stored **apart from the others**, indicating tampering.
    
- Glyph is linked to **Professor Endra’s field of study**.
    
- Steward Rellin handled the wine and got **paid recently by someone anonymous** (letter found on a nearby table, half-burned).

###  2. **The Baron’s Study – Secrets & Blackmail**

>  Checks:

- **Perception (DC 14):** Find a note tucked behind a painting — half of a burned letter with the phrase _“…your secret is safe, so long as you honor our deal.”_
    
- **Investigation (DC 16):** Spot a faint outline on the floor — a **hidden trapdoor** under the rug.
    
- **Dexterity (DC 15):** Pick the lock to open it.
    
- **Stealth (DC 12):** Avoid alerting a patrolling guard or servant.
    

>  Clues:

- The letter matches **Mira Valcoran’s handwriting** (compare with place cards or notes from her room).
    
- The trapdoor leads to **a hidden room** with a journal containing notes on blackmail, debts, and _a regretful entry about a “final toast.”_
    
- There’s also a **second goblet**—untouched—inscribed with glyphs only **Professor Endra** would know how to hide.

###  3. **Guest Bedroom – Masked Movements**

>  Checks:

- **Survival (DC 13):** Track muddy bootprints in the hallway leading away from the ballroom—at odds with the pristine floors.
    
- **Perception (DC 14):** Hear rustling or whispering behind a wardrobe.
    
- **Athletics (DC 12):** Force the wardrobe aside to reveal a secret passage.
    
- **Deception vs Insight (NPC):** Thorne Merrick is hiding something — he claims to have been “performing” all evening.
    

>  Clues:

- The hidden passage connects the **bedrooms to the wine cellar**, bypassing the ballroom.
    
- A scarf smelling of incense is caught on a hook — **Mira wears that scent.**
    
- Thorne’s costume has **wine stains** on the inner sleeve — he was near the cellar, despite saying otherwise.

##  Puzzle-Like Deduction

These clues point in different directions but interweave:

- **Rellin** had access, motive, and payment — the likely _tool_.
    
- **Mira** blackmailed the Baron, had a secret passage, and a motive.
    
- **Professor Endra** is tied to the magical glyph and feels betrayed.
    
- **Thorne** lied about his location, has the performance vial with similar poison, and old grudges.
    

Players can:

- Confront NPCs with clues (Persuasion, Intimidation, Insight rolls).
    
- Present a theory and name the killer.
    
- Be wrong — and risk more time passing, or even angering the Baron’s spirit (if you want a ghost twist).

##  Optional Mechanic: Time Pressure Track

Give them 4 "clue phases" before the seal collapses.

- **After Phase 2**: A second NPC is poisoned (up to you who dies — maybe Celeste or Rellin).
    
- **After Phase 3**: Lights begin to flicker, and they hear whispers—hint at a supernatural escalation.
    
- **After Phase 4**: Either final confrontation, or a ghost fight with the Baron's wrath manifesting.
