## Places for Investigation
---

###  **1. The Wine Cellar – Rellin, the Steward**

>  Checks:

- **Investigation (DC 15):** Spot that _only one_ bottle is missing from a sealed vintage collection.
    
- **Arcana (DC 13):** Detect a faint magical glyph on the bottle shelf (a delayed necrotic sigil).
    
- **Insight (DC 15):** Notice the steward is _sweating more than he should be_, avoiding eye contact.
    

>  Clues:

- The poisoned bottle was stored **apart from the others**, indicating tampering.
    
- Glyph is linked to **Professor Endra’s field of study**.
    
- Steward Rellin handled the wine and got **paid recently by someone anonymous** (letter found on a nearby table, half-burned).
    

---

###  **2. The Baron’s Study – Professor Endra Quill**

>  Checks:

- **Perception (DC 14):** Find a note tucked behind a painting — half of a burned letter with the phrase _“…your secret is safe, so long as you honor our deal.”_
	
- **Investigation (DC 16):** Spot a faint outline on the floor — a **hidden trapdoor** under the rug.
    
- **Dexterity (DC 15):** Pick the lock to open it.
    
- **Stealth (DC 12):** Avoid alerting a patrolling guard or servant.
    

>  Clues:

- The letter matches **Mira Valcoran’s handwriting** (compare with place cards or notes from her room).
    
- The trapdoor leads to **a hidden room** with a journal containing notes on blackmail, debts, and _a regretful entry about a “final toast.”_
    
- There’s also a **second goblet**—untouched—inscribed with glyphs only **Professor Endra** would know how to hide.

###  **3. Guest Bedroom – Mira Valcoran**

>  Checks:

- **Survival (DC 13):** Track muddy bootprints in the hallway leading away from the ballroom—at odds with the pristine floors.
    
- **Perception (DC 14):** Hear rustling or whispering behind a wardrobe.
    
- **Athletics (DC 12):** Force the wardrobe aside to reveal a secret passage.
    
- **Deception vs Insight (NPC):** Thorne Merrick is hiding something — he claims to have been “performing” all evening.
    

>  Clues:

- The hidden passage connects the **bedrooms to the wine cellar**, bypassing the ballroom.
    
- A scarf smelling of incense is caught on a hook — **Mira wears that scent.**
    
- Thorne’s costume has **wine stains** on the inner sleeve — he was near the cellar, despite saying otherwise.
    

---
###  **4. Ballroom – Thorne Merrick**

> Checks:

- **Investigation (DC 14):** Inspect the Baron’s goblet — no residue, but magically clean.
    
- **Arcana (DC 15):** Trace faint lingering necrotic magic — possibly from a glyph trigger.
    
- **Insight (DC 13):** Thorne is _trying too hard_ to keep attention off the cellar.
    

> Clues:

- Goblet was magically cleaned — someone knew spells.
    
- The poison must’ve been delivered _just before_ the toast.
    
- Thorne’s sleeve is damp with wine; he claims it’s from “spilling backstage.”
---
### **5. Greenhouse Garden – Lady Celeste Velwin  **

> Checks:

- **Survival (DC 13):** Muddy footprints lead in from the outer path—_not visible from indoors._
    
- **Insight (DC 12):** Celeste is more shaken than expected — hiding something emotional.
    
- **Nature (DC 13):** A plant nearby has been _crushed recently_, as if someone stumbled through it.
    

> Clues:

- Celeste wasn’t alone — a _second set of prints_ leads in and back out again.
    
- A fallen glove near the door bears a **masquerade emblem not matching any guest**.

##  Puzzle-Like Deduction

These clues point in different directions but interweave:

- **Rellin** had access, motive, and payment — the likely _tool_.
    
- **Mira** blackmailed the Baron, had a secret passage, and a motive.
    
- **Professor Endra** is tied to the magical glyph and feels betrayed.
    
- **Thorne** lied about his location, has the performance vial with similar poison, and old grudges.
    

Players can:

- Confront NPCs with clues (Persuasion, Intimidation, Insight rolls).
    
- Present a theory and name the killer.
    
- Be wrong — and risk more time passing, or even angering the Baron’s spirit (if you want a ghost twist).

##  Optional Mechanic: Time Pressure Track

Give them 4 "clue phases" before the seal collapses.

- **After Phase 2**: A second NPC is poisoned (up to you who dies — maybe Celeste or Rellin).
    
- **After Phase 3**: Lights begin to flicker, and they hear whispers—hint at a supernatural escalation.
    
- **After Phase 4**: Either final confrontation, or a ghost fight with the Baron's wrath manifesting.

## How It all went down
To start Mira Valcoran is the killer. But not everyone is innocent. Mira is the heir to the Valcoran family but she started to blackmail the Baron to do her bidding. ~~The baron was going to rat her out and tell everyone that she practices forbidden magic.~~ 

Here's how she did it: First she learned enough magic to replicate Professor Endra Vott's glyphs. And Used a secret passage to get into the wine cellar. She then bribed Rellin to make sure that the bottle of wine was the one that was served to the baron. and for he to hide it after
