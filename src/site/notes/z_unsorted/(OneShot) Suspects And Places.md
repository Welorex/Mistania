## **Key NPCs for _Murder at the Midnight Masquerade_**

This will all be printed in a doc, this is here just to view :)

---

###  **Lady Celeste Velwin**

- **Role:** The Baron’s younger sister. Always in his shadow. Elegant, cold, and biting.

- **Secret:** She was **seen arguing with the Baron** the night before in the garden.


 _“He always thought himself clever… but cleverness gets you nowhere without legacy.”_

---

###  **Rellin, the Steward**

- **Role:** The wine steward. Nervous, twitchy, and overly polite.

- **Secret:** He **handled the wine bottle** before the toast, and his ledger shows a payment from an anonymous source.

---

###  **Thorne Merrick**

- **Role:** Charming masked bard and hired entertainer. Formerly a courtier in the Baron’s employ.

- **Secret:** Carries a **vial of similar poison** (used for “stage effects”), but swears it wasn’t used.


 _“Let’s not pretend he didn’t deserve a little retribution. Doesn’t mean I _killed_ him.”_

---

###  **Professor Endra Vott**

- **Role:** Arcane scholar and old friend of the Baron. Knows about magical glyphs.

- **Secret:** She recognizes the glyph from the wine bottle—it's tied to a **banned necromantic school**.


 _“Knowledge isn’t evil. What people do with it… that’s another matter entirely.”_

---

###  **Mira Valcoran**

- **Role:** A mysterious masked noblewoman. Dazzling, witty, and hard to read.

- **Secret:** She has **letters between her and the Baron**, burned at the edges but still readable.


 _“Dead men tell no tales… though they leave behind _such_ interesting correspondence.”_

## Places for Investigation
---

###  **1. The Wine Cellar – Rellin, the Steward**

>  Checks:

	- **Arcana (DC 13):** Detect a faint magical glyph on the bottle shelf (a delayed necrotic sigil).

- **Insight (DC 15):** Notice the steward is _sweating more than he should be_, avoiding eye contact.

- **Investigation (DC 17):** A part of the wall seems separate from the rest.

	- **Strength Check (DC 14):** Push the wall, showing a secret passage
	- **Perception (DC 13):*** To find the switch to open the passage


>  Clues:

---

###  **2. The Study – Professor Endra Quill**

>  Checks:

- **Perception (DC 12)**: One of the books has been re-shelved incorrectly and contains a crumpled paper.

- **Perception (DC 14):** Find a note tucked behind a painting — half of a burned letter with the phrase _“…your payment is safe, so long as you honor our deal.”_ (He has insane debt)

- **Perception (DC 16):** Find some notes stuffed inside the bookshelf from **Professor Endra**, with some very harsh words.

	- **Dexterity (DC 13):** Pick the lock to open it.
	- **Investigation (DC 13):** Find threats from Mira



>  Clues:

- The letter was from **Mira Valcoran** 

- The trapdoor leads to **a hidden room** with a journal containing notes on blackmail, debts, and _a regretful entry about a “final toast.”_

- There’s also a **vial of poison**—untouched

- The **crumpled paper** is a copied glyph reference from Endra’s notes — someone has been studying his magic.


---

###  **3. Guest Bedroom – Mira Valcoran**

>  Checks:

- **Survival (DC 13):** Track muddy bootprints in the hallway leading away from the ballroom and into the greenhouse

- **Perception (DC 14):** Hear rustling or whispering behind a wardrobe.

- **Athletics (DC 12):** Force the wardrobe aside to reveal a secret passage.

- **Deception vs Insight (NPC):** Mire Valcoran is hiding something, she claims to have been at the ball all evening.


>  Clues:

- The hidden passage connects the **bedrooms to the wine cellar**, bypassing the ballroom.

- A scarf smelling of incense is caught on a hook — **Mira wears that scent.**

- Mira's dress has some mud on it, even though she said she never left the ballroom


---
###  **4. Ballroom – Thorne Merrick**

> Checks:

- **Investigation (DC 14):** Inspect the Baron’s goblet — no residue, but magically clean.

- **Arcana (DC 14):** Trace faint lingering necrotic magic — possibly from a glyph trigger.

- **Insight (DC 13):** Thorne is _trying too hard_ to keep attention off the cellar.


> Clues:

- Goblet was magically cleaned — someone knew spells.

- The poison must’ve been delivered _just before_ the toast.

- Thorne’s sleeve is damp with wine; he claims it’s from “spilling backstage.”

- A **panicked noble** saw someone leave the ballroom “shortly before the toast” — describes a figure in dark green (Mira’s dress color).

---
### **5. Greenhouse Garden – Lady Celeste Velwin  **

> Checks:

- **Survival (DC 13):** Muddy footprints lead in from the outer path—_not visible from indoors._

- **Insight (DC 12):** Celeste is more shaken than expected — hiding something emotional.

- **Nature (DC 13):** A plant nearby has been _crushed recently_, as if someone stumbled through it.

- **Nature (DC 15):** One herb here (bloodroot) is toxic if magically refined — one pot is missing some clippings.

- **Insight (DC 13)**: Mira had access to this room often, despite not being into plants — unusual for a noble.

> Clues:

- Celeste wasn’t alone — a _second set of prints_ leads in and back out again.

- A fallen glove near the door bears a **masquerade emblem not matching any guest**.

- A **burned paper scrap** in a brazier: “Rellin will serve as the scapegoat. Make sure he handles the wine.”

---
## Round Mechanic
The players get five rounds of investigation. First they chose with room they want to investigate. Then make checks inside that room, and talk to the npc who is in there. If they use the secret passage they switch rooms that round and can't go back to the previous room.

## Optional Mechanic: Time Pressure Track

- **After Phase 2**: Rellin Dies.

- **After Phase 4**: The Greenhouse gets trashed, all checks are gone.

- **After Phase 5**: The barrier falls and Mira gets away

---
## How It all went down
To start Mira Valcoran is the killer. But not everyone is innocent. The reason that Mira killed the Baron was because he set up a marriage with his younger brother and she wants out.

Here's how she did it: First she learned enough magic to replicate Professor Endra Vott's glyphs. And Used a secret passage to get into the wine cellar. She then bribed Rellin to make sure that the bottle of wine was the one that was served to the baron. and for he to hide it after he baron dies. Endra wasn't happy with the baron due to cuts in funding and had some angry letters to him, she stole those to make it seem like Endra was the killer. Thorne was pay anonymously to make a "extra" dramatic performance and thinks its part of the show, and to fake an accident backstage (wine spill), he doesn't know what's happening. Lady Celeste meet Mira before the ball but got dumped and stayed in there for the rest of the night. Silas saw Mira and Rellin talking but thinks that the boy wouldn't do something so foolish. After poisoning the bottle Mira did normal ball things and waited to see the baron die.
