## Introduction
This is a small oneshot that I made for my family and friends who have not even played D&D
### Session description
They have all been invited to the Midnight Masquerade, a fabulous ball that the Velwin Family throws every summer solstice. As the party comes to a high, The Baron raises his glass for a toast. Before falling dead after drinking his wine. The arcane barrier is activated, making sure no one can leave or enter. But it can only hold for so long. It is up to the adventures to find the culprit before the clock strikes midnight.

### Opening Monologue

> **“You have all been invited to the Midnight Masquerade, the grandest event of the summer solstice, hosted by the prestigious Velwin family. As the revelry reaches its peak, Baron Aric Velwin raises his glass for a toast… only to collapse dead moments after sipping his wine. A surge of magic pulses through the estate as an arcane barrier locks the mansion down—no one can leave, and no one can enter. But the spell is unstable. When the clock strikes midnight, the seal will break... and chaos will follow.**

## Lets Start it off with a Murder
Somebody dies. Oh no!

### The Toast to end all toasts
The Baron raises his glass and everyone falls silent. He clears his throat and says his toast.

_"Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, and cherished friends,_

_Tonight, we gather not only to celebrate the summer solstice, but to toast to all that is _unspoken_, all that is _undiscovered_. For what are we if not creatures of ambition, driven by desires known only to ourselves and to the night?_

_May our secrets be safe for another year, our fortunes grow, and our hearts remain as warm as the fires that light this magnificent hall. To the Velwin legacy—may it endure, may it prosper, and may the mysteries of this world forever be ours to claim._

_Cheers, my friends, to the future!”_
