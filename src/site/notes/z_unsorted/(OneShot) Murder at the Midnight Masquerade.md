## Introduction
This is a small oneshot that I made for my family and friends who have not even played D&D. I'll be DMing this game on friday the 18th of April 2025 and that's why I can't do a full day thing.
### Session description
They have all been invited to the Midnight Masquerade, a fabulous ball that the Velwin Family throws every summer solstice. As the party comes to a high, The Baron raises his glass for a toast. Before falling dead after drinking his wine. The arcane barrier is activated, making sure no one can leave or enter. But it can only hold for so long. It is up to the adventures to find the culprit before the clock strikes midnight. 

### Opening Monologue

> **“You have all been invited to the Midnight Masquerade, the grandest event of the summer solstice, hosted by the prestigious Velwin family. As the revelry reaches its peak, Baron Aric Velwin raises his glass for a toast… only to collapse dead moments after sipping his wine. A surge of magic pulses through the estate as an arcane barrier locks the mansion down—no one can leave, and no one can enter. But the spell is unstable. When the clock strikes midnight, the seal will break... and chaos will follow.**

## Lets Start it off with a Murder
Somebody dies. Oh no!

### The Toast to end all toasts
The Baron raises his glass and everyone falls silent. He clears his throat and says his toast.

_"Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, and cherished friends,_

_Tonight, we gather not only to celebrate the summer solstice, but to toast to all that is _unspoken_, all that is _undiscovered_. For what are we if not creatures of ambition, driven by desires known only to ourselves and to the night?_

_May our secrets be safe for another year, our fortunes grow, and our hearts remain as warm as the fires that light this magnificent hall. To the Velwin legacy—may it endure, may it prosper, and may the mysteries of this world forever be ours to claim._

_Cheers, my friends, to the future!”_

### Bro is cold... and on the floor
**With those words, the Baron takes a sip from his glass...**  
But before the cheers can echo across the room, his face contorts. Foam begins to spill from his mouth, and he collapses, crashing to the floor in a sickening thud. The crowd gasps, a wave of panic rippling through the guests.

**The ballroom erupts into chaos.**  
Guests scream, servants rush to the Baron’s side, and the air is thick with confusion and fear. Suddenly, the ground trembles as if the estate itself is alive. A low, deep rumbling fills the air as an arcane seal flares to life, glowing with dangerous energy. The doors slam shut, locking with a finality that echoes throughout the estate.

**A voice booms from the shadows—a guard steps forward, trying to regain order, his voice strained but firm.**

_"Please, everyone remain calm! The arcane barrier is a safety precaution. We are handling the situation. Once the culprit is found, you will all be allowed to leave."_

### I'm just going to make this your problem
Now with everyone settle, the guard tell the adventures that need need help. They need to watch the guest and you need to go find out who killed the baron, and fast the arcane barrier won't hold forever. They have until midnight to find the culprit or they escape. They give them a list of people to investigate. (See [[z_unsorted/(OneShot) Suspects And Places\|(OneShot) Suspects And Places]])
