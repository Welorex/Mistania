> _"Every great journey begins at Brightshield."_

Brightshield sits at the entrance to the **Verdant Expanse**, the largest grassland in Solaria. Known as the **City of Adventure**, it has earned its name as the starting point for countless legendary journeys. **The first Adventurers’ Guild hall** was founded here, making it a hotspot for mercenaries, explorers, and treasure hunters seeking their fortune in the unknown.

The city's economy thrives on adventurers, with **blacksmiths, enchanters, alchemists, and traders** catering to those preparing for their next quest. Taverns overflow with tales of distant lands, lost relics, and undiscovered dungeons. Despite its rough-and-tumble nature, Brightshield is far from lawless—the influence of the **Adventurers’ Guild** and noble patrons like **House Blackthorne** ensures that order is maintained, even if it’s a looser, more practical form of justice.

Those who dream of glory, wealth, or discovery often find themselves drawn to Brightshield. Some will rise to legend, while others will fade into forgotten stories—but all will remember the city where their adventure began.
