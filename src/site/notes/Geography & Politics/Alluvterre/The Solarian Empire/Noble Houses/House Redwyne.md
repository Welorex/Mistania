House Redwyne is the guardian of the **Imperial Highlands**, a rugged, mountainous region crucial for its rich resources and natural defenses. Their warriors are unmatched in mountain warfare, and they oversee vital mines that supply the empire with precious metals and stone. Though they rarely meddle in politics, their loyalty to the empire is unquestionable, and their word carries great weight when it is spoken.
