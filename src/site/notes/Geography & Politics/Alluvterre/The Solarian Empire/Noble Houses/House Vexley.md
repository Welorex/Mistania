> _"Knowledge is power, and we hold the key."_

House Vexley is the patron of scholars, inventors, and alchemists. They oversee the empireâ€™s greatest libraries, universities, and research institutions, pushing the boundaries of magic and technology. The **Arcane Institute of Newhaven** falls under their influence, and they hold strong ties with [[Eldermyst Labs\|Eldermyst Labs]]. Their hunger for knowledge is unmatched, but some fear they may be delving into dangerous experiments best left untouched.
