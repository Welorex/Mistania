### History

Mistania was once a single, unified continent. However, after the cataclysmic event known as [[Geography & Politics/Other things/The Great Divide\|The Great Divide]], the land was split into three distinct continents. See the [[Geography & Politics/Other things/Map of Mistania\|Map of Mistania]] for reference.

With this division, it no longer made sense to call all three regions "Mistania." Instead, Mistania became the name of the world itself, while the newly formed continents were named [[Alluveterre\|Alluveterre]], [[Eternalia\|Eternalia]], and [[Rimeshire\|Rimeshire]]. Additionally, the [[The Zephyr Isles\|The Zephyr Isles]]—which had existed long before [[Geography & Politics/Other things/The Great Divide\|The Great Divide]]—remain an important part of Mistania.

### Species

Mistania is home to a vast array of species, ranging from the small to the mighty. However, the [[Geography & Politics/Other things/United Empires\|United Empires]] recognize five primary species: [[Humans\|Humans]], [[Elves\|Elves]], [[Smallfolk\|Smallfolk]], [[DragonBorn\|DragonBorn]], and [[Orcs\|Orcs]].

These dominant species hold the most land and political power across Mistania. Of course, many other species inhabit the world, and I have documented nearly all of them in [[Other Species\|Other Species]].

### Empires

Mistania is governed by five major empires, each led by one of the primary species:

- **[[Geography & Politics/Alluvterre/The Solarian Empire/The Solarian Empire\|The Solarian Empire]]** – Ruled by the [[Humans\|Humans]]
- **[[The Eldran Empire\|The Eldran Empire]]** – Ruled by the [[Elves\|Elves]]
- **[[Loamnore Kingdom\|Loamnore Kingdom]]** – Ruled by the [[Smallfolk\|Smallfolk]]
- **[[The Zephyr Isles\|The Zephyr Isles]]** – Ruled by the [[DragonBorn\|DragonBorn]]
- **[[The Ravagog Dominion\|The Ravagog Dominion]]** – Ruled by the [[Orcs\|Orcs]]

These empires divide and govern the lands of Mistania.
