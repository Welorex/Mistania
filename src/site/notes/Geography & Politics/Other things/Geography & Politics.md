## Continents

Then there is [[Rimeshire\|Rimeshire]], where harsh conditions forge resilient communities amidst rugged terrain and frozen landscapes.

The [[Golden Griffin Trading Co\|Golden Griffin Trading Co]] rules the market on weapons, armors and everything in between, while the [[Velmara Trade Consortium\|Velmara Trade Consortium]] has the most amount of auction houses on the continent. [[Eldermyst Labs\|Eldermyst Labs]] leads in the sale of magic item, scrolls, and potions. Unfortunately since these big corporations fight all the time [[Family Shops\|Family Shops]] are hit with less people and barely scrap by. Meanwhile, more illicit businesses like the [[Black Market\|Black Market]] and [[Slave Trade\|Slave Trade]] operate in the shadows, exploiting the world’s darkest corners.

## Cities and Towns

The cities and towns of Mistania are as diverse as its people, each with its own unique history and culture. In [[Alluveterre\|Alluveterre]], you'll find bustling trade hubs like [[Gildenspire\|Gildenspire]] and [[Lightton\|Lightton]], or peaceful retreat towns like [[Geography & Politics/Alluvterre/The Solarian Empire/Cities/Brightshield\|Brightshield]] and [[Newhaven\|Newhaven]]. [[Rimeshire\|Rimeshire]] is home to the fortified stronghold of [[Noxus\|Noxus]] and the industrious [[Korrgian\|Korrgian]], while [[Eternalia\|Eternalia]] offers the serene [[Elmyrion\|Elmyrion]] and the ancient [[Sylvandell\|Sylvandell]].

## Landmarks

The [[Dragon’s Back\|Dragon’s Back]] in the [[Zephyr Isles\|Zephyr Isles]] and the [[Cloudripple Range\|Cloudripple Range]] in [[Rimeshire\|Rimeshire]] are natural wonders, while the [[Silvercrest Mountains\|Silvercrest Mountains]] of [[Eternalia\|Eternalia]] and [[Skyspire Peaks\|Skyspire Peaks]] in [[Alluveterre\|Alluveterre]] form a protective barrier around the lands.

Vast, barren lands like the [[Ironveil Flats\|Ironveil Flats]] and [[Gray Barrens\|Gray Barrens]] stretch across [[Alluveterre\|Alluveterre]], while the [[Verdant Expanse\|Verdant Expanse]] offers fertile fields and forests.
