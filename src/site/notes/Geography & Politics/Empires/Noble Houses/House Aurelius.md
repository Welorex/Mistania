> _"Strength is not in blood, but in unity."_

House Aurelius is the most progressive and inclusive of Solarian’s noble families, known for welcoming other species into its ranks. They believe the empire is strongest when all people—human or not—contribute to its prosperity. Their lands are a melting pot of cultures, featuring bustling trade cities and centers of diplomacy. Despite their openness, many traditionalist nobles look down on them, seeing their ideals as a weakness rather than a virtue.
