### History
Mistania was once a fully connected continent but after the [[The Great Divide\|The Great Divide]], it has now been split into three pieces, See The [[Map of Mistania\|Map of Mistania]]. After The Great Divide it wasn't fit to call all three new continents Mistania, So they named the world Mistania and the three continents [[Alluveterre\|Alluveterre]], [[Eternalia\|Eternalia]], and [[Rimeshire\|Rimeshire]], there are also the [[The Zephyr Isles\|The Zephyr Isles]] but they have existed long before The Great Divide.

### Species
Mistania is home to many species small and large, but the agreed upon by the [[Geography & Politics/United Empires\|United Empires]] there are five main species; The [[Humans\|Humans]], [[Elves\|Elves]], [[Smallfolk\|Smallfolk]], [[DragonBorn\|DragonBorn]], and [[Orcs\|Orcs]].
The main species control or populate the most land in Mistania. There are many more species who live in Mistania and I've documented nearly all of them in the [[Other Species\|Other Species]].

### Empires
There are the five empires in Mistania:
- [[Geography & Politics/Empires/The Solarian Empire\|The Solarian Empire]]; Under the control of the [[Humans\|Humans]]
- [[The Eldran Empire\|The Eldran Empire]]; Under the control of the [[Elves\|Elves]]
- [[Loamnore Kingdom\|Loamnore Kingdom]]; Under the control of the [[Smallfolk\|Smallfolk]]
- [[The Zephyr Isles\|The Zephyr Isles]]; Under the control of the [[DragonBorn\|DragonBorn]]
- [[The Ravagog Dominion\|The Ravagog Dominion]]; Under the rule of the [[Orcs\|Orcs]]

These empires share all the land in Mistania.
