## History
After [[The Great Divide\|The Great Divide]] and all species got split up, [[Geography & Politics/Empires/The Solarian Empire\|The Solarian Empire]] and the [[The Eldran Empire\|The Eldran Empire]] collaborated to make [[Mysterium\|Mysterium]], here all empires could meet and talk about what is happening in their empire and request aid. This was the start of the United Empires.

## Members
United Empires is made of the five biggest empire and representative of each minority. 
- [[Geography & Politics/Empires/The Solarian Empire\|The Solarian Empire]]
- [[The Eldran Empire\|The Eldran Empire]]

## How it works
The United Empires meet twice a year, one at the start of a new year and one in the middle. During these meeting they talk about current state of their empire, any problems that are in need of solutions, and how their special project is going. During the year every empire can call one emergency meeting where they in most cases require aid; due to a natural disaster, riots, or in extremes cases the end of their empire. After the empires make a vote to decide if the situation deserves immediate aid or even any aid, if not then the empires will still help them but over a longer period. Afterword everybody goes home or stays in [[Mysterium\|Mysterium]] for work related things.

### Special Project
When any new empire joins the United Empires they are given a Special Project. This Project is to benefit all of Mistania. We only know of one completed Special Project; [[The Warp Gate\|The Warp Gate]] from Oriashire, to Blacktop. Such feat of engineering by the [[Smallfolk\|Smallfolk]] is truly remarkable. The other Special Projects are said to be nearing completion and I can't wait to find out what it is.
