### Traits
**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the hollow to 0 Hit Points, it makes a Constitution saving throw (DC 5 plus the damage taken) unless the damage is Radiant or from a Critical Hit. On a successful save, the hollow drops to 1 Hit Point instead.

_**Keen Hearing and Smell.**_ The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

### Actions
**Multiattack.** The Hollow makes two attacks, one with its bite and one with its claws.

_**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with the Hollowing.

_**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with the Hollowing.
