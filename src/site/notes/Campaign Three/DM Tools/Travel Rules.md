Traveling is a core part of dungeons and dragons. These are the rules we will follow during the campaign when traveling on the hexmap.

### Travel Pace
D&D rules state that a normal travel day is 8 hours covering 24 miles, that assumes that you are traveling on simple terrain like roads, open plains, or clear dungeons. In these rules we will are using the 8 hour travel day as a base for the time you have for traveling. 

A character on horseback moves twice as fast when entering a road, plains, or hill hex.


### Hex Types
In these rules there are four different type of hexes, each type takes a certain amount of time to travers into, the hex types are listed below.

#### Exploring a Hex
A party can spend some time thoroughly exploring a hex. Doing so takes the same amount of time as entering that hex would of been, being of horseback confers no benefits here, and reveals any hidden locations that might be in a hex. Such as a hidden dungeon, landmark or treasure. 

| Hex Type        | Time    |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Road            | 1 hour  |
| Plains or Hills | 2 hours |
| Forest or Bog   | 4 hours |
| Mountain        | 8 hours |
### Wilderness Day
At the start of every day, each character must consume one ration or an equivalent amount of food. After that the DM rolls for the weather or any other related checks.

A full day of exploration 8 hours long, and any time spent exploring beyond that risks driving one or more members of the party to exhaustion. Whenever a party finishes entering Or exploring a hex, if they have spent more than 8 hours exploring that day, tally up the additional hours spent and ask each character to make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8. Each character that fails suffers one level of exhaustion.

### Resting in the Wilderness
Unlike resting in a small town or city, resting in the wilderness is much more dangerous. 
A long rest can be taken once every 24 hours over the course of 8 hours. During a long rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading talking, eating, or standing watch. 

During sleep, you are unconscious, After you finish a rest you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one.

**Interrupting a Long Rest.** Any long rest is stopped by the following interruptions:
- Rolling initiative
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage

If the rest is interrupted, the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.
