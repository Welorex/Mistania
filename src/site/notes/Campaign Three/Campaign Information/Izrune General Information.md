### Pantheon of Izrune
The gods of Izrune are ancient beings who shape the world through their will, embodying the forces of life, death, war, and fate. Mortals call upon them in times of triumph and despair, though few truly understand their motives. Each god carries a domain, a symbol, and a temperament that colors their worshippersâ€™ lives.
