Here you will find the session recaps, I include everything we did that I have written down and what I remember, Sorry if I forgot something. 

### Session 1
We began our adventure by entering **Starwhisper's Rest**, a tavern in the town of **Yardashtin**, which sits on the edge of the **Tanglewilds**. We'd all come there after hearing a rumor about an old man looking for adventurers to help him retrieve an ancient artifact.

We all ended up at the same table and introduced ourselves. Then, to our surprise, the barkeep revealed himself to be the one who started the rumor. His name was **Thailum Starwhisper**, and he gave us a quest to prove ourselves: clear out some nearby goblin ruins.

On the way there, we ran into some wolves, which we killed. **Jonathan** and **Vessurak** each kept a corpse for dinner later. At the entrance to the ruins, Vessurak tripped an alarm because of his abysmal passive perception. Once inside, we fought and killed the kobolds living there and discovered that some goblins were trapped in the basement.

**Vanitas** nearly died, but the DM decided otherwise. We also fought some skeletons guarding treasure, including gold and a **clockwork amulet**. While heading into the basement, Jonathan triggered a boulder trap, but luckily, we found a button that opened a stone door.

In the basement, we found goblins trying to destroy a statue of their god, **Maglubiyet**. They had rejected him and wanted the statue gone. We helped them smash it, and they invited us to their warcamp, known as the **Wobbley Warcamp**.

When we returned, Thailum said we had proven ourselves. To end the session, Jonathan and Vessurak had a drinking contest, Vessurak won, because there were no rules for drinking in D&D.

### Session 2
Since the DM didn’t have much prepared, we spent this session exploring the town.

First, we met **Bragda Oakfoot**, owner of _Oakfoot Ironworks_. Vessurak sold some items there. Next, we met **Glida Wyrmbelly**, who runs _Wyrmbelly Wares_, a caravan-turned-shop that sells a bit of everything.

Jonathan then split off from the group and returned to _Starwhisper’s Rest_ for a drink, while the rest of the party visited _Thornbend Stables_. There, Vessurak asked about a mount that doesn’t even exist in the PHB. Things got out of hand when **Balasar** used _breath weapon_ on the poor stablehand, who thought Balasar was an illusionist—since the townsfolk had apparently never seen magic before. Long story short, **Riker Underhill** (the stable owner) is _not_ a fan of us now.

Meanwhile, Jonathan met **Durgen Glintgrip**, a lute-playing dwarf, and they hit it off.

Then Vanitas visited the _Hollow Fang_ and spoke with **Dale Yoken**, the local guild leader, and pocketed a gold reward for the quest we did. At the same time, Vessurak and Balasar went to the _Council Hall_, where they met **Nobble**, a frail young boy, and **Heinrick Stell**, apparently an important council member.

Back to Jonathan—he decided he wanted to tame a duck. So he went to _Burrowise Bakery_ and met **Merrybell Undermead** (or just _Merry_), grabbed some bread, and shared his plan with the rest of the party. While Jonathan went off to pursue his duck-taming dream, the others picked up a job from the _Hollow Fang_ quest board and cleared out a house full of giant rats.

Jonathan, in the meantime, kidnapped a whole family of ducks. After buying more bread from Merry, he sought someone who could speak to animals. He asked Thailum for help, who sent him to **Darla Greenthorn’s** hut. She helped him communicate with the ducks, and in return for the bread, they agreed to let him keep one old duck instead of the whole family.

To wrap up the session, Jonathan had another drink with Durgen.
