# Welcome To Eryndor!

 **To all esteemed guest of this website, welcome to the homepage of Sebass's Campaign!**
##### Notice 
This is just for maps, notes, and anything I (Welorex), want to add to keep track on. So without further ado welcome. Below is the map of Eryndor and notes that I have written in my notebook, you can view them here and tell me what to add and what to change if you want. I will update it after every session so stay tuned.

The map is here because Discord doesn't allow files over 10mb to be uploaded without nitro. I could have put a screenshot but the quality would be lower.

Anything still related to my Campaign can still be found in the **My Campaign** Folder. I'll also start adding things there for the next part of my Campaign.

## The Map of Eryndor
**A remade map curtesy of me!**
